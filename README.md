# Simple scatter plot
This extremely simple Python script uses Matplotlib to create a scatter plot from data extracted from an excel file. 

It was created to provide useful graphics for working on lab reports using Latex and without relying solely on Excel to do so. It is intended to be useful for those with little coding experience, as was my case when I wrote it. There's still so much room for improvement.

## Excel file structure
The excel file ``data_to_plot.xlsx`` has two sheets. The ``data`` one is where the data to plot has to be placed, while the ``labels`` is there to further customize the resulting chart with its title, axis labels and more.
