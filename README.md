# Simple scatter plot
This Python script uses Matplotlib to create a scatter plot from data extracted from an excel file. 

## Excel file structure
The excel file ``data_to_plot.xlsx`` has two sheets. The ``data`` one is where the data to plot has to be placed, while the ``labels`` is there to further customize the resulting chart with its title, axis labels and more.
