# Simple scatter plot
This Python script uses Matplotlib to create a scatter plot from data extracted from an excel file. 

This was created in order to provide useful plots for working on lab reports using Latex and without relying solely on Excel for that purpose. 

## Excel file structure
The excel file ``data_to_plot.xlsx`` has two sheets. The ``data`` one is where the data to plot has to be placed, while the ``labels`` is there to further customize the resulting chart with its title, axis labels and more.
